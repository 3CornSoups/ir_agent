    "t2va": """integrated_multimodal_description: [Shot 1] Live-action, cinematic, a medium-wide shot frames a baker opening the shutters of a small street bakery before sunrise. The camera pushes in with small amplitude at slow speed as the middle-aged baker with a calm, slightly raspy voice (S1) places a fresh loaf on the wooden counter and says: <d>[English] First batch of the morning.</d> [Shot 2] At 00:05.000, the camera cuts to a close-up of steam rising from the sliced bread while the baker's final words carry over from the previous shot.

overall_soundscape: Wooden shutters scrape open over a quiet street as trays clink softly inside the bakery. The doorbell rings once, followed by light footsteps and the crisp sound of bread being sliced.

non_diegetic_music: A soft acoustic-guitar pattern at a moderate tempo, joined by sparse upright-bass notes and a gentle fade at the end.""",

Her reflection moves across the glass while the quiet, breathy young woman (S1) says: <d>[English] I get off at the next station.</d> She folds the letter along its existing crease.

overall_soundscape: The train wheels produce a steady metallic rhythm beneath a low ventilation hum. Rain ticks against the window while paper rustles softly in her hands.

integrated_multimodal_description: [Shot 1] Live-action, cinematic, a close shot begins with an intact drinking glass near the edge of a dark wooden table, while the same hand and sleeve visible in <Picture 1> approach from the right. The camera pushes in with small amplitude at slow speed as the fingertips strike the rim. The glass tips, falls, and hits the floor with a sharp impact; cracks spread through it as fragments slide outward.

non_diegetic_music: A low electronic pulse at a slow tempo, ending immediately after the glass breaks.""",
    "r2va": """subject_definitions:
<Subject 1> is the coffee-shop environment in <Picture 1>, featuring an exposed brick wall, an orange tufted sofa with patterned pillows, a neon sign, and a wooden coffee table.
<Subject 2> is the fluffy white Samoyed in <Picture 2>, <Picture 3>, and <Picture 4>, with thick white fur, pointed ears, a dark nose, and a curved tail.

summary:
[reference generation + audio reference] The target video shows <Subject 3> eating a cookie in <Subject 1>. <Subject 4> enters with <Subject 2>, which lunges toward the cookie. The three-shot exchange uses <Audio 1> as the voice-timbre reference for <Subject 3> and ends with a canned audience laugh.

retention_analysis:
<Subject 1> (appears in [Shot 1], [Shot 2], [Shot 3]): fully_preserved - the exposed brick wall, orange tufted sofa, patterned pillows, neon sign, and wooden coffee table are retained.
<Subject 2> (appears in [Shot 1], [Shot 2]): fully_preserved - the Samoyed's thick white fur, pointed ears, dark nose, and curved tail are retained.
<Subject 3> (appears in [Shot 1], [Shot 2], [Shot 3]): fully_preserved - the blonde woman's identity, long hair, and light-pink shirt are retained.
<Subject 4> (appears in [Shot 1], [Shot 2]): fully_preserved - the young man's short wavy brown hair and dark-grey hoodie are retained.
<Audio 1>: reference - its vocal timbre guides the dialogue delivery of <Subject 3> without copying the original signal.

detailed_description:
The target video uses a realistic multi-camera sitcom style with warm indoor lighting.
[Shot 1] A medium shot establishes <Subject 1>, the coffee shop with its exposed brick wall, orange tufted sofa, patterned pillows, neon sign, and wooden coffee table. <Subject 3> (S1), the young woman with long blonde hair and a light-pink button-down shirt with rolled-up sleeves, sits on the sofa holding a chocolate-chip cookie. From the left, <Subject 4>, the young man with short wavy brown hair and a dark-grey hoodie with drawstrings, enters holding the leash of <Subject 2>, the thick-furred white Samoyed with pointed ears, a dark nose, and a curved tail. The dog lunges toward the cookie and pulls the leash taut. <Subject 3> (S1) jerks her hand back and, using the clear youthful voice timbre referenced from <Audio 1>, exclaims with light annoyance, <d>[English] Hey! Watch your dog!</d> She closes her lips and guards the cookie while <Subject 4> pulls the dog back.
[Shot 2] At 00:03.000, the shot cuts to a close-up of <Subject 4> (S2), the young man in the dark-grey hoodie from Shot 1, sitting beside <Subject 3> on the sofa and holding <Subject 2> securely in his arms. <Subject 4> (S2) says in a casual young male voice with a playful tone and an easy conversational pace, <d>[English] He just likes cookies more than me.</d> He closes his mouth into an apologetic smile and strokes the dog's thick white fur.
[Shot 3] At 00:05.000, the shot cuts to a close-up of <Subject 3> (S1), the blonde woman in the light-pink shirt from Shot 1. Her annoyance softens as she looks toward the Samoyed. <Subject 3> (S1) replies in the same clear youthful voice referenced from <Audio 1> with an amused cadence, <d>[English] Well, he has good taste at least.</d> She smiles and raises the cookie in a small toast-like gesture. A classic canned audience laugh begins immediately after the line and continues through the final frame.

overall_soundscape:
Soft indoor coffee-shop room tone continues throughout the scene.
